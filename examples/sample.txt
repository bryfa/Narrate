Welcome to Narrate, the teleprompter and subtitle application. This is a sample plain text file that will be automatically converted into timed clips.

Each paragraph becomes a separate clip. The duration is automatically calculated based on the word count, assuming a typical reading speed of about 2.5 words per second.

Words within each clip are evenly distributed across the clip's duration. This makes it easy to import scripts without having to manually time every word.

Perfect for creating teleprompter scripts from plain text documents. Just write your script as normal paragraphs and import it into Narrate.

The automatic timing can be adjusted later using Narrate's editing features. You can fine-tune word positions and clip boundaries as needed.
